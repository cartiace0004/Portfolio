## 👨‍💻 About Me

I'm a self-taught data analyst passionate about transforming raw data into meaningful business insights. With a foundation in **SQL, Python (Pandas, Seaborn), Power BI**, and spreadsheet tools like **Excel and Google Sheets**, I’ve built hands-on projects focused on:

- 📦 **E-commerce sales & supply chain analysis**
- 🎬 **Movie industry correlation analysis**
- 🧑‍💼 **Employee attrition exploration**
- 📊 **Customer behavior & delivery trend dashboards**

Despite not finishing my college degree due to financial limitations, I've completed professional courses on platforms like **Udemy** and **Cisco Networking Academy**, and continuously grow my skills through real-world data projects.
